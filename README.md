# UIUC Course Compass — v1.1.2

**What’s new:**
- Business Core Math still “one-of”; marking any (e.g., STAT 100) satisfies it.
- **General Education buckets** (Comp I, Adv Comp, Humanities & Arts, Nat Sci & Tech, Cultural Studies x3, Quantitative Reasoning, Language) now have a **“Completed” checkbox** on the **Completed** page.
- **Remaining** page shows **professors inline beneath each course** (no dropdown).
- Each professor has a generated **Avg GPA** and **Rating**.
- **Plan** at the professor level → planning stores the selected **professor** and **section** automatically.
- Light, web-first UI.
