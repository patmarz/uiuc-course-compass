# UIUC Course Compass — v1.1.3

**Fixes & tweaks**
- Completed page always shows the 3 requirement accordions (opens by default on first load).
- Illini palette: all text in **Illini Orange**; buttons in **Illini Blue** for contrast.
- Still web-only (no service worker).

**Flow**
Sign in → Completed → Remaining (professors inline, per-prof plan) → Schedule.

Run locally:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```
